Device-Tree Bindings for a PPS Signal on GPIO

These properties describe a PPS (pulse-per-second) signal connected to
a GPIO pin.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "pps-gpio"
- gpios: one PPS GPIO in the format described by ../gpio/gpio.txt

Optional properties:
- assert-falling-edge: when present, assert is indicated by a falling edge
                       (instead of by a rising edge)
- capture-clear:       when present, capture both assert (start of timepulse) and
		       clear (end of timepulse) events. Usually desireable.
- source-name:	       when present, allows user specification of device name.
  		       This allows systems with multiple KPPS devices to construct
		       a map between device tree entries and /dev/ppsN. If
		       unspecified, defaults to the auto-generated name of prior code.
- source-path:	       when present, allows user specification of the serial GPS
  		       device (as a tty device) associated with this KPPS device.
		       This allows systems with multiple KPPS and GPS serial
		       devices to construct a map between devices.

Example:
	pps {
		compatible = "pps-gpio";
		gpios = <&gpio2 6 0>;
		source-name = "ublox_max7";
		source-path = "/dev/ttyO4";
		capture-clear;
		assert-falling-edge;  /* atypical */
	};
